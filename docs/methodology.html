    <h2>What is Banana Radar?</h2>
    <p>
      Banana Radar is an on-chain system designed to observe how consensus
      forms over time around newly launched tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not predict prices, issue trading signals, or provide investment advice.
      The system records verifiable on-chain events and tracks their evolution over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Why no price prediction?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Price predictions are not verifiable</li>
      <li>Short-term movements are dominated by noise</li>
      <li>Single-point signals are easy to manipulate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Banana Radar focuses on persistence and survivability rather than speculation.
    </p>

    <h2>Definition of Consensus</h2>
    <p>
      In Banana Radar, consensus does not refer to popularity or short-term price action.
      A token is observed only after it has:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Been launched through a real liquidity pool</li>
      <li>Passed baseline on-chain checks</li>
      <li>Continued to exist without structural failure</li>
      <li>Survived multiple on-chain observations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Time is treated as the primary signal.
    </p>

    <h2>Consensus States</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>EARLY</b>: Recently passed baseline checks</li>
      <li><b>STABLE</b>: Sustained existence through an initial observation window</li>
      <li><b>CORE</b>: Long-term persistence across multiple observation periods</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      These states are descriptive, not predictive.
    </p>

    <h2>Role of AI</h2>
    <p>
      AI is used to summarize and explain observed on-chain data.
      It does not determine token status, predict outcomes, or generate trading advice.
    </p>

    <h2>Important Notice</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Banana Radar is a research and observation tool.
